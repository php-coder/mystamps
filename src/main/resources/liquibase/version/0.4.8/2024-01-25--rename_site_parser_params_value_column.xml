		Rename column "value" as it's a reserved word in SQL.
		Newer versions of H2 don't allow to use it as unquoted identifier.
		See for details: https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3954

			NOTE: columnDataType is only required for MySQL.
			We specify NOT NULL constraint, in order to keep it, otherwise it gets discarded.
			This happens because on MySQL < 8.0, there was no a dedicated command for column
			renaming and ALTER TABLE column CHANGE has been used instead. The latter is designed
			for modifying column's data type and that's why it requires a full column's definition.
