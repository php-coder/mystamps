	${text}=             Get Text  ${locator}
	Should Match Regexp  ${text}  ${regexp}

# Workaround for "Textfield Value Should Be" that causes NPE with <input type="url">:
# https://github.com/Hi-Fi/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java/issues/52
Urlfield Value Should Be
	[Documentation]  Verifies text field locator has exactly text expected
	[Arguments]      ${locator}  ${expected}

Select Country
	[Documentation]                   Select the given value in a select list that is using selectize.js

	# We can't use "Select From List By Label" because
	# 1) it doesn't work with invisible elements (and selectize.js makes field invisible)
	# 2) selectize.js dynamically creates list of countries only when we're clicking on the field
	Click Element                     id=country-selectized
